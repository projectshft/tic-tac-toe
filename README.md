## Towers of Hanoi

This is the classic Towers of Hanoi exercise that many programmers train their skills on.   The goal of Towers of Hanoi is to move a set of discs of different sizes from one peg to another while only allowing the player to take the topmost disc off the peg and not putting a larger disc on top of a smaller one.
